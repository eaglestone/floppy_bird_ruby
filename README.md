Floppy Bird Ruby
================

Flappy Bird rip-off in Ruby using the [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) library.

This is me procrastinating when I should be planning lessons! Works on Windows with Ruby 1.9.3. It was an exercise to see how creating it in Ruby compared with Scratch: Ruby was easier, quicker and the result better IMO.

A Windows .exe is also included that was created with Ocra, but you will need the media asset files in the same directory for it to work.

Sounds are from freesfx.co.uk
